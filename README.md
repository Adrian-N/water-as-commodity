# Fresh Water as Commodity
Building AI course project
## Summary
We all need water. It is one of the most valuable resource as there is no substitute for it. This project focuses on analysing data from multiple resources to predict the next cities most likely to get fresh water shortages and be in danger of encountering what scientist call “Day Zero”. Thusly we can avert potentially water crises around the globe.

## Background

Fresh water shortage is not a new problem. Many cities and countless villages in Africa faced fresh water access issues for generations. Most recent example would be Cape Town South Africa water crisis in 2017.

Each year there are simply more people on Earth consuming more water. In most places in the world water is treaded and priced like there will always be enough of it. Some cities are using it in absurdly wasteful ways not worrying about the future. Last minute realization might have devastating effects on city economics and people lives. It is simply matter of time we will see cases such us Cape Town in America, Europe and Asia.
The aim of this project is not to fix current issues but to rather predict where water crisis will pop up on planet earth in the coming years. This way we can provide officials with a hard data therefore they can start preparing for weather anomalies and dry periods.

Avoiding fresh water shortages is possible but work needs to start before problem arrives. The earlier the work starts, the cheaper and more efficient the solution might be. Some of the potential solutions are desalination, infrastructure of alternative water resources, water price increases, improving current water frameworks or identifying water leaks.

## Data Sources

Fresh water access and consumption can be more complicated than it seems to be. There are many different causes of water shortages and well as many different potential water sources. Potential data resources for AI are:
* Dependence of Aquifer – Aquifers are like saving account, water will eventually run out if we are using it too fast. 
* Dry Periods – How did dry periods changed over the years and how will it impact the city future 
* Rainfalls – Are we to expect more or less rain in a future?
* City water consumption – will this go up and how fast?
* Dry area movement in a particular continent.
* Access to river and how far the river source is.
* Current city progress on desalination – if city is already exploring this option.

## AI Methods
The goal is simple, what is a probability of a water crisis in a future for a particular city. We can treat each data source listed above as single neuron and apply different AI method to it. If enough neurons show high probability of a future water shortages, then we have a potential candidate for a city that will encounter water crisis in the future. We can also apply different importance value to each neuron. For example, low rainfalls and high dependency on aquifer might looks like a bad news for a city but they might be already aware and have advance research on desalination.

Odds and probability are going to be important subjects in this project. We will have to do our best to predict future dry periods, rainfalls and water consumption. Looking at past water crisis around the word might provide valuable insights. Cape Town water crisis was a period of severe water shortage, first signs were shown in 2015 in a form of drought and in January 2018 City had to declare highest water restrictions before cutting water supply completely.

## Challenges
Biggest challenges would be most likely discovered during the project itself however following two issues are evident straight away. Firstly, it will be up to city officials to act based on project findings. Data will have to be carefully researched for the project to be as credible and trustful as possible. Second issue is with project magnitude. Due to amount of data, their sources and different ways of AI methods, this project has a capability to grow into immense proportions.

## What Next?
It is hard to answer this question now as it depends on how successful this projects become. Water shortages are just one of many environmental issues. I would recommend using gained experience and knowledge to tackle another human crisis.
